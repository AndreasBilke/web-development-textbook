Zuerst betrachten wir zwei Schritte aus der Definition von [Thread Modeling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling) der OWASP:


## Assessment Scope

> Assessment Scope - The first step is always to understand whatâ€™s on the line. Identifying tangible
> assets, like databases of information or sensitive files is usually easy. Understanding the
> capabilities provided by the application and valuing them is more difficult. Less concrete things, such
> as reputation and goodwill are the most difficult to measure, but are often the most critical.



## Identify Threat Agents and Possible Attacks

> Identify Threat Agents and Possible Attacks - A key part of the threat model is a characterization of
> the different groups of people who might be able to attack your application. These groups should
> include insiders and outsiders, performing both inadvertent mistakes and malicious attacks.
